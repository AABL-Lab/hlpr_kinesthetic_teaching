This repo used to include the `hlpr_record_demonstration` package, which has been superseded by `hlpr_kinesthetic_teaching_api`. You can find the old package in the Git history. The `rqt_kinesthetic_teaching` GUI, `hlpr_kinesthetic_interaction` utility package, and the `hlpr_kinesthetic_teaching` metapackage also resided here.
